	Pronounced: I-Day. Pronouns: She/Her.</p>
 	<p style="font-size:1.3rem"> 
	Aide is a London based multi disciplined designer with experience in Graphics, UX & Illustration. 

	Aide has a great energy, is very enthusiastic, and likes to take on challenges. She is very task-orientated. I’ve noticed that when starting a new task, she tends to ask a lot of questions, which works with my working style as clarity is important. 
	</p>

<br>
   	<p style="font-size:1.3rem">  
	Aide is proficient in many programs;
	
	<ul style="font-size:1.3rem"><b>	UX:	</b>	Adobe XD, Figma, Sketch HTML and CSS.</ul>
	<ul style="font-size:1.3rem"><b>	Graphics: </b>	Adobe Illustrator, InDesign, After Effects and Photoshop.</ul>
	<ul style="font-size:1.3rem"><b>	Illustration: </b>	Adobe Illustrator, Procreate and InDesign.</ul>
	</p>

<br>
 	<p  style="font-size:1.3rem"> Her design style follows the K.I.S.S principle, usually clean and simple. She loves to use mixed media, she says it caused to needing to take inspiration from as many places as possible. It’s obvious that design is her true passion and that she prides herself on the desire to learn.

	In summation, though relatively new to design, she is a fast learner with a great eye, and a pleasure to work with.</p>
