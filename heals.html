							Heals Instructional video for Hullabalooks technology 
						</h3>
						<p>	Introduction and Context Setting:
							<br>
							When Heals approached me with the exciting opportunity to create an instructional video for Hullabalooks technology on their website, I was thrilled to embark on this creative endeavor. The challenge presented was to produce a video that strikes the perfect balance between simplicity, style, brand cohesion, and creativity, all while ensuring ease of understanding for the audience.
	<br>
	<br>						Understanding Heals Aesthetics:
	<br>
							Emphasis is placed on understanding the aesthetics of the Heals brand to ensure alignment throughout the video.
							The goal is to integrate the brand's identity seamlessly into every aspect of the video's production.
	<br>
	<br>						Meticulous Crafting:
	<br>
							Delving into the project with a focus on detail, the video aims to merge visual design and narrative structure in a cohesive manner.
							Every element, from graphics to storytelling techniques, is carefully chosen to resonate with the Heals ethos.
	<br>
	<br>						Curated Experience:
	<br>
							The video is positioned not just as a set of instructions but as a holistic experience for the viewer.
							Simplicity ensures accessibility, while stylish presentation reflects the sophistication synonymous with Heals.
	<br>
	<br>
							Incorporating Creativity: <br>

							Creativity is infused into each frame of the video, elevating it beyond mere instructional content.
							The goal is to make the video not just informative but also visually engaging and memorable.
	<br>
	<br>						
							Guided Exploration:<br>

							Viewers are taken on a journey through Hullabalooks technology, guided with clarity and flair.
							User-friendly explanations ensure even those unfamiliar with the technology can easily follow along.
							<br>
	<br>
							End Result: <br>

							The video's culmination is a captivating and educational piece that achieves its purpose while leaving a lasting impression.
							It embodies the fusion of simplicity, style, creativity, and brand coherence, representing the essence of the Heals brand.

							Feedback on intial design
						</h3>
						<p>
						Inital feedback highlighted brand's core colours, blue and black. The emphasis was clear and simplify the vibrant hues and concentrate on integrating the brand's core colors. This adjustment not only demonstrated a keen responsiveness to client feedback but also underscored the commitment to aligning the video's aesthetic seamlessly with Heals' brand identity.
